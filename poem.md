# Old Ireland


Far hence amid an isle of wondrous beauty,<br> 
Crouching over a _grave an ancient sorrowful mother_,<br>
Once a queen, now lean and tatter'd seated on the ground,<br> 
Her old white hair drooping dishevel'd round her shoulders,<br> 
At her feet fallen an unused royal harp,<br> 
Long silent, she too long silent, _mourning her shrouded hope and heir_,<br>
Of all the earth her heart most full of sorrow because most full of love.<br>  

_Yet a word ancient mother_,<br> 
You need crouch there no longer on the cold ground with forehead between your knees,<br> 
O you need not sit there veil'd in your old white hair so dishevel'd,<br> 
For know you the one you mourn is not in that grave,<br> 
It was an illusion, _the son you love was not really dead_,<br> 
The Lord is not dead, he is risen again young and strong in another country,<br> 
Even while you wept there by your fallen harp by the grave,<br> 
What you wept for was translated, pass'd from the grave,<br> 
The winds favor'd and the sea sail'd it,<br> 
And now with rosy and new blood,<br> 
Moves to-day in a new country.<br>
